# Walls Remember – OSINT CTF Challenge

##  Challenge Description

A simple photo was uploaded to a developer’s public repository.  
At first glance, it looks like an ordinary picture.

However, nothing on the internet is ever truly random.

Your mission is to follow the digital traces, analyze the available information, and uncover what the walls are trying to tell you.

 **Note**  

All necessary information is publicly accessible through open-source intelligence techniques.
